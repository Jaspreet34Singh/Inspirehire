Steps to create a Git Repository.

## Initialize a Folder

1. Choose the folder you want to add, Right click and click on “open Git bash here”
2. GIT bash opens up. 
3. The very first step is to initialize the folder and to do it use command `git init` .
4. To confirm the initialization, enter `git status` , it will tell what branch are you in and also the untracked files inside that folder.

## Track a File

Track the file means git will keep track of all the changes that were made for the folder that is being tracked.

1. To make a file track type `git add name_of_file` 
2. If you want to untrack a file type `git rm -cached name_of_file` .
3. To track all the file at once, type `git add —all`,  `git add -A` or `git add .` 

## Ignore a file

To make a file ignore or in other words hide the file and tell git to not track it. To make this possible follow the steps:

1. In the file explorer create a text file name `.gitignore`  .
2. Open the file.
3. Add a comment and write ignore all txt files.
4. You have to add the extension of the file that you want to ignore or name of the exact file which you want to ignore. 
    
    [.gitignore](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/724a7dbf-880a-43f8-a19b-1db2b1fc24b8/bb3ff250-1b21-4026-b720-7df85f7fe431/.gitignore)
    
5. If you type `git status`  you will no longer see the file you mentioned in gitignore. 

## Commit the file

Commit means taking a current snapshot of the file, means saving the current state of a folder and if you want to go back you can do that as well. To do so follow the steps:

1. Enter `git commit -m “message to go along with this commit like added a animation to the file etc. ”` 
2. When you git status you will find the section is  empty as all the files are now committed and no change is made after that commit.

## Changes after commit

When you change something after committing something on  git, git will identify those small changes and will tell you when you check the status. If you want to see the changes enter, `git diff` .
